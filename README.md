# Splunk

**Splunk SIEM** that focuses on using Splunk for **security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response** in a simulated enterprise environment.

---

### **Project Title: Comprehensive Threat Detection and Incident Response with Splunk SIEM**

---

### **Objective:**
Deploy and configure **Splunk SIEM** to monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents in real-time. This project involves integrating multiple data sources, building custom correlation searches, creating dashboards for incident management, and automating incident response using **Splunk Phantom**.

---

### **Scope:**
- Set up **Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)** to collect and analyze logs from various sources, including network devices, firewalls, servers, and endpoint systems.
- Build custom correlation searches to detect specific threats, such as brute-force attacks, malware infections, and data exfiltration.
- Use **Splunk Phantom** (now called **Splunk SOAR**) for automated incident response, creating playbooks for common security incidents.
- Develop real-time security dashboards for monitoring key security metrics and ensuring compliance with security policies.

---

### **Project Steps:**

### 1. **Environment Setup**
   - **Simulate a Network Environment**: Create a virtual environment using VMware, AWS, or Azure, simulating an enterprise network with web servers, database servers, and domain controllers.
   - **Deploy Security Tools**: Set up network firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and endpoint detection tools to generate security logs.
   - **Splunk Installation**: Install and configure **Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)** in your environment. Ensure all necessary hardware or virtual resources are available for optimal Splunk performance.

### 2. **Data Ingestion**
   - **Log Collection and Parsing**:
     - Configure **Universal Forwarders** to collect logs from endpoints and servers (Windows, Linux).
     - Set up **syslog** or **Splunk Connect for Syslog** to ingest logs from network devices like firewalls, IDS/IPS.
     - Ingest logs from **cloud platforms** (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure) and security tools (e.g., CrowdStrike, Palo Alto).
   - **Data Normalization**: Ensure logs are properly parsed and normalized using **Splunk’s Common Information Model (CIM)**, which standardizes data from different sources for better analysis and correlation.

### 3. **Threat Detection Use Cases**
   - **Custom Correlation Searches**: Create correlation searches to detect common attack vectors:
     - **Brute-force attacks**: Correlate multiple failed login attempts across the network in a short time period.
     - **Malware Detection**: Analyze logs for signs of malware infections, including communication with known malicious domains and unusual file changes.
     - **Suspicious User Behavior**: Use **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)** to track and detect unusual patterns, such as after-hours logins, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.
   - **Security Monitoring Alerts**: Set up real-time alerts for high-severity incidents, such as:
     - Privilege escalation attempts.
     - Ransomware attacks or encryption of critical files.
     - Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### 4. **Dashboards and Visualization**
   - **Custom Security Dashboards**: Build dashboards for security operations that display:
     - Real-time threat landscape.
     - Active security incidents.
     - Historical trends of security incidents (e.g., successful vs. failed attacks).
     - Asset health and event summaries.
   - **Compliance Dashboards**: Develop dashboards for regulatory compliance (e.g., **PCI-DSS**, **HIPAA**), showing activities like file access, data movement, and network traffic that align with compliance requirements.

### 5. **Automated Incident Response with Splunk Phantom (SOAR)**
   - **Playbook Creation**: Develop automated playbooks in Splunk Phantom to respond to specific incidents:
     - **Account Lockout Playbook**: Automatically lock an account after detecting multiple failed login attempts indicative of a brute-force attack.
     - **Malware Response Playbook**: If malware is detected on an endpoint, isolate the system from the network and initiate a forensic analysis workflow.
     - **Suspicious File Transfer Playbook**: Detect and block unauthorized file transfers by integrating with network firewalls.
   - **Automated Escalation**: Create workflows that notify security teams when critical incidents (e.g., ransomware attacks or data exfiltration) occur.
   - **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Enrich alerts with external threat intelligence feeds to add context (e.g., IP reputation, malware hashes) and automatically take action based on severity.

### 6. **Advanced Threat Hunting**
   - **Threat Hunting Queries**: Use Splunk’s search processing language (SPL) to conduct proactive threat hunting:
     - Investigate anomalies such as rare processes running on endpoints.
     - Track suspicious user activity and lateral movement across the network.
     - Analyze network traffic patterns for signs of exfiltration or communication with command-and-control servers.
   - **Behavior Analytics**: Use UEBA features within Splunk to continuously monitor and detect deviations from normal user behavior that could indicate compromised accounts or insider threats.

### 7. **Incident Simulation & Testing**
   - **Simulate Security Incidents**: Use tools like **Metasploit** or **Atomic Red Team** to simulate security incidents, such as:
     - Phishing attack leading to compromised credentials.
     - Ransomware infection encrypting important data.
     - Data exfiltration over non-standard ports.
   - **Evaluate Detection and Response**: Ensure that Splunk SIEM can detect the simulated incidents and that the playbooks respond accordingly.
   - **Measure Response Time**: Analyze how quickly the system detects, escalates, and responds to incidents using automated workflows and alerting.

### 8. **Reporting and Post-Incident Review**
   - **Incident Reports**: Generate detailed reports on each incident, outlining the sequence of events, root cause, actions taken, and recommendations for future prevention.
   - **Security Metrics Reports**: Report key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
     - Mean Time to Detect (MTTD).
     - Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).
     - Volume of incidents by severity and type.
   - **Post-Incident Analysis**: Conduct a retrospective review to evaluate the effectiveness of the detection, response, and playbooks. Identify areas for improvement and update playbooks accordingly.

---

### **Deliverables:**
- Fully operational **Splunk Enterprise Security** instance with real-time monitoring.
- Custom correlation searches and alerts for detecting security threats.
- Automated playbooks using **Splunk Phantom** for incident response.
- Comprehensive security dashboards and compliance reports.
- Incident reports and post-incident analysis documentation.

---

### **Outcomes:**
- Enhanced detection of advanced threats (e.g., brute-force, malware, insider threats).
- Significant reduction in **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** and **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** due to automation via **Splunk Phantom**.
- Comprehensive monitoring of security events with customized dashboards for real-time visibility.
- Automated incident response workflows that reduce manual intervention and improve efficiency in handling security incidents.
- Compliance with industry standards through continuous monitoring and reporting on activities related to sensitive data and regulatory requirements.
